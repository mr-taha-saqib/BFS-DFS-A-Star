## **PART 1: Implementation of Blind Search Algorithm**

### **Problem Statement**
You need to implement a **cube solver** using blind search algorithms:  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  

### **Cube Representation**
The cube is represented as a 2D array where:  
- `0`: Open spaces  
- `1`: Walls  
- **Start (S)**: Located at `(0, 0)` (top-left corner)  
- **Goal (G)**: Located at `(n-1, m-1)` (bottom-right corner)  

**Example Cube:**
